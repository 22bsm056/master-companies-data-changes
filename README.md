## Overview

The MCA Insights Engine is a comprehensive Python-based system designed to:

* Consolidate and normalize MCA company data from data.gov.in
* Detect daily company-level changes with field-level accuracy
* Track over one million companies across India in real-time
* Analyze data trends using AI-driven natural language queries
* Visualize results with interactive dashboards

* Real-time, interactive data visualizations
